# Badminton ML Study – Stroke Execution Quality

## Overview
This project explores whether simplified, handcrafted stroke-related features
(e.g., swing speed, racket angle, body balance)
contain predictive signals for badminton stroke execution quality.

The study focuses on classical machine learning methods
as a foundation before introducing temporal or deep learning models.

## Problem Setting
- Task: Binary classification
- Input: Stroke-related features
- Output: Execution quality (good / poor)

This task assumes that shuttlecock contact has already occurred
and that a fixed stroke type (e.g., smash) is considered.

## Purpose
This is an exploratory study aimed at:
- validating feature usefulness
- clarifying problem formulation
- building intuition for ML pipeline design

It is not intended to be a production-ready evaluation system.

For detailed problem formulation and study design, see `docs/project_notes.md`.
